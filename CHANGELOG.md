### Added
- **Native Healer & L2 Vault Bridging**:
  - Implemented Go-native endpoints for `heal` and `vault/count` in the sidecar server.
  - Re-wired the TypeScript `healerRouter` to delegate all health and history queries to the Go kernel.
  - Unified the "Immune System" dashboard metrics with the Go `HealerService` state.
- **Ground Truth Mapping**:
  - Established field mapping (snake_case to PascalCase) for native records to ensure seamless UI integration without modifying the Go kernel's idiomatic output.

  - Implemented single-instance CLI dispatcher. Clicking deep links routes actions through the active `hypercoded` daemon via HTTP REST.
- **SQLite L2 Vector Vault Visualizer**:
  - Implemented persistent database queries (`GetAllVaultRecords`) in Go fetching chronic vault memories ordered by importance and heat.
  - Wired the new tRPC `vaultRecords` query to the Next.js control plane to hook persistent SQLite vector records into the UI.
  - Re-designed the Healer dashboard in glassmorphic dark-mode, showing streaming active pathogens side-by-side with real persistent L2 Vault records.
- **Next.js Dashboard Routes**:
  - Added premium, highly interactive dashboard console cards for Blocks, Claude Chrome, Claude Cloud, Copilot, and OpenAI Codex.
- **LLM Instruction Unification**:
  - Resolved merge conflict markers and aligned role guidelines across `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `GPT.md`, and `copilot-instructions.md` under `docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

  - New `HealerService` in the Go kernel with a multi-turn `diagnose -> fix -> verify -> retry` loop.
  - Integration with `CodeExecutor` for native, sandboxed verification (tsc, vitest, go test).
  - L2 Vault persistence: All healing events and extracted facts are saved as long-term memory for fleet-wide intelligence sharing.

### Changed
- Standardized documentation identity to Hypercode Kernel & HyperCode.
- Updated `VERSION.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `TODO.md` to reflect Phase 5 active sprint goals.
- Unified `docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` as the single source of truth for all AI agents.
