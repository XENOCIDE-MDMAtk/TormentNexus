# HANDOFF — Session 2026-07-01 R31 (Dashboard Subpage Redirects Middleware - Alpha.211)

## Summary

In this session, we consolidated and simplified the dashboard routing by eliminating subpage navigation friction:

1. **Next.js Routing Middleware**:
   - Coded [middleware.ts](file:///c:/Users/hyper/workspace/tormentnexus/apps/web/src/middleware.ts) to intercept requests to all legacy subpages (e.g. `/dashboard/brain`, `/dashboard/tool-console`, `/dashboard/billing`) and automatically redirect the browser to their consolidated high-density targets on `/dashboard?tab=page-...` (`page-a`, `page-b`, `page-c`, or `page-d`).
2. **Build Validation**:
   - Verified that type-checking compiles cleanly across the web workspace (`pnpm -C apps/web exec tsc --noEmit`).
3. **Workspace Version Sync**:
   - Bumped version to `1.0.0-alpha.211` and synchronized all packages.

# HANDOFF — Session 2026-07-01 R30 (React Duplicate Key Resolution - Alpha.210)

## Summary

In this session, we resolved remaining frontend duplicate key warnings and synced the workspace versions:

1. **React Key Warnings Resolution**:
   - Fixed React unique key console errors in the Memory Hydration view (`view.tsx` at line 394) by substituting flat `entry.id` keys with unique composite key strings (`${entry.section}-${entry.key}-${entry.id}`).
   - Coded composite keys (`${tag}-${idx}`) for memory tag lists inside `view.tsx` to handle tag duplicates safely.
2. **TypeScript & Go Build Pass**:
   - Build-verified Next.js code cleanly (`pnpm -C apps/web exec tsc --noEmit`) with zero errors.
   - Built the Go sidecar executable successfully (`go build -buildvcs=false ./cmd/tormentnexus`).
3. **Workspace Version Propagation**:
   - Set target version to `1.0.0-alpha.210` in `VERSION` and executed `sync-versions.mjs` to dynamically align all 33 package configurations.

# HANDOFF — Session 2026-07-01 R29 (Native Go Session Ingestion & Recovery Pipeline - Alpha.209)

## Summary

In this session, we fully implemented and verified the database recovery ingestion loops and native Go fallbacks:

1. **Native Go Session Import Fallback**:
   - Refactored `handleSessionImport` in [server.go](file:///c:/Users/hyper/workspace/tormentnexus/go/internal/httpapi/server.go) to gracefully fall back locally when the TypeScript control plane is offline.
   - Programmed the Go HTTP handler to parse incoming JSON payloads and route them directly to the `sessionimport` Go engine.
2. **SQLite Schema Constraint Protection**:
   - Updated `ImportSession` in [import.go](file:///c:/Users/hyper/workspace/tormentnexus/go/internal/sessionimport/import.go) to automatically calculate SHA256 `transcript_hash` values for each session and populate default empty JSON structs `{}` for the `normalized_session` metadata column, resolving SQLite constraint exceptions.
3. **Loopback Port Binding Resolution**:
   - Resolved a Windows networking conflict in [import_sessions.py](file:///c:/Users/hyper/workspace/tormentnexus/scripts/import_sessions.py) by targeting `127.0.0.1:7778` instead of `localhost:4300`, preventing IPv6 loopback connection hangs.
4. **Successful Ingestion Runs**:
   - Imported all **228 episodic sessions** successfully into `tormentnexus.db`.
   - Verified that `./internal/sessionimport` and `./internal/httpapi` Go unit tests compile and pass cleanly.
   - Synchronized all workspace dependencies and versions dynamically to `1.0.0-alpha.209`.

# HANDOFF — Session 2026-07-01 R28 (TormentNexus Unified Dashboard Layout & Sidebar Navigation - Alpha.208)

## Summary

In this session, we completed the implementation of the **TormentNexus Unified Dashboard Layout** and consolidated the navigation controls:

1. **TormentNexus Unified Dashboard Layout (page-a to page-d)**:
   - Designed and built the tab-conditional panels in [dashboard-home-view.tsx](file:///c:/Users/hyper/workspace/tormentnexus/apps/web/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-home-view.tsx) for Page A (Recovery & Sync), Page B (Go MCP & Tools), Page C (Memory & Skills), and Page D (Prompts & Deployments).
   - Resolved compiler JSX Element return type errors by fixing mismatched function curly braces and unclosed `setTimeout` bounds for `triggerDiagnostics`, `triggerSchemaSync`, `toggleAlwaysOn`, `triggerSwarmGen`, `triggerFolderScan`, `triggerLinkRestoration`, and `triggerStaticDeploy`.
2. **Consolidated Sidebar Config**:
   - Updated [nav-config.ts](file:///c:/Users/hyper/workspace/tormentnexus/apps/web/src/components/mcp/nav-config.ts) to remap the sidebar paths to target the correct tab query segments `/dashboard?tab=page-a`, `/dashboard?tab=page-b`, `/dashboard?tab=page-c`, and `/dashboard?tab=page-d`.
3. **Workspace Build & Type Safety**:
   - Verified that the entire Next.js web application compiles cleanly without errors using `pnpm -C apps/web exec tsc --noEmit`.
   - Bumped the workspace package version dynamically to `1.0.0-alpha.208` using `node scripts/sync-versions.mjs`.

# HANDOFF — Session 2026-07-01 R27 (Subpage Consolidation, tRPC Bridge Fixes, and Version Sync - Alpha.206)

## Summary

In this session, we completed the following updates:

1. **tRPC Bridge Batching and Unwrapping**:
   - Resolved connection termination (`net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE`) in the Go sidecar's tRPC bridge handler by detecting batch requests when `batch=1` query parameter is present.
   - Added automatic unwrapping of the `"json"` parameters serialization layer from tRPC client payloads.
   - Marshaled and forwarded unwrapped flat inputs directly to target HTTP routes.
2. **Reverse Proxy Route Remapping & Prefixing**:
   - Automatically prepended `api/` to request paths inside `/api/go/[...path]` route that do not start with `api/` or other system prefixes, resolving `404 Not Found` for memory hydration status endpoint requests.
3. **Dashboard Subpage Consolidation**:
   - Redirected all legacy subpages (`/dashboard/mcp/*`, `/dashboard/memory/*`, `/dashboard/code/*`, `/dashboard/health/*`) to use unified single-page tab controllers, preventing navigation fragmentation and keeping the dashboard streamlined.
   - Refactored `/dashboard/sessions/import` to render as a tab (`Session Importer`) on the main `SwarmDashboard` view, writing a redirect page to preserve browser compatibility.
4. **DOM Key & telemetry Fallback Improvements**:
   - Resolved React unique key console warnings in `tool-karma` and `swarm` map loops by adding fallback key generators.
5. **Version Bump and Build**:
   - Synchronized all monorepo dependencies and configurations cleanly to `1.0.0-alpha.206`.
   - Verified compile safety with a successful Next production static build.

1. **Dashboard UI Layout & Tooltip Additions**:
   - Designed a new `InfoTooltip` React helper inside [view.tsx](file:///c:/Users/hyper/workspace/tormentnexus/apps/web/src/app/dashboard/brain/view.tsx) utilizing the `Info` icon.
   - Inserted interactive, self-documenting hover explanations for each of the main Stats cards (Session, Working, Long Term, Observations) and Core Memory Scratchpad keys to make the UI simpler to follow.
2. **Version Bump and Build**:
   - Clean compiled both components, synchronized versions to `1.0.0-alpha.203`, and restarted the live Go sidecar daemon instance.

---

# HANDOFF — Session 2026-07-01 R25 (Always-on Configurations Alignment and Version Sync - Alpha.202)

## Summary

In this session, we completed the following updates:

1. **Always-On Configuration Storage Alignment**:
   - Modified [route.ts](file:///c:/Users/hyper/workspace/tormentnexus/apps/web/src/app/api/tools/always-on/route.ts) to locate and write the configurations inside the parent workspace `data/always-on-tools.json` folder so the Go sidecar and Next.js APIs share the exact same configuration states.
2. **Binary and UI Rebuild**:
   - Built frontend files and regenerated Go executables cleanly.

---

# HANDOFF — Session 2026-07-01 R24 (Assimilation Scrapers and Version Sync - Alpha.201)

## Summary

In this session, we completed the following updates:

1. **Comprehensive Library Scrapers**:
   - Programmed [assimilation_handlers.go](file:///c:/Users/hyper/workspace/tormentnexus/go/internal/httpapi/assimilation_handlers.go) exposing endpoints to call python scripts (`assimilate_all_resources.py` and `assimilate_mcp_servers.py`).
   - Added an interactive scraper trigger widget inside the Web Ingestion tab in the Brain View dashboard layout, capturing console outputs.
2. **Build Sync**:
   - Rebuilt all frontend pages and compiled sidecar daemon binaries.

   - Exposed `GET /api/memory/scratchpad/get` and `POST /api/memory/scratchpad/set` in Go REST HTTP router.
   - Integrated a dedicated **Core Memory (Letta)** tab inside [view.tsx](file:///c:/Users/hyper/workspace/tormentnexus/apps/web/src/app/dashboard/brain/view.tsx) containing card widgets to edit persona/human scratchpad values dynamically with automatic state save.
2. **Workspace Verification & Binary Sync**:
   - Build-verified all static pages and refreshed the Wails desktop frontend assets.

---

# HANDOFF — Session 2026-07-01 R22 (Consolidation Triggers, Tool Parameter Reference Widgets, and Version Sync - Alpha.199)

## Summary

In this session, we completed all requested improvements:

1. **Interactive Tool Console Parameter Helpers**:
   - Upgraded [page.tsx](file:///c:/Users/hyper/workspace/tormentnexus/apps/web/src/app/dashboard/tool-console/page.tsx) to render a parameters reference box adjacent to the JSON input box on the execute tab, showing descriptions and schemas.
2. **Manual Memory Consolidation**:

# HANDOFF — Session 2026-07-01 R21 (Database Restoration, Catalog Sync, and Full Workspace Build - Alpha.198)

## Summary

In this session, we executed a complete data recovery and workspace compilation cycle:

1. **Database Restoration**:
   - Restored `tormentnexus.db` (60.6 MB) from the `bobbybookmarks` backup archive, returning the workspace to its rich context state.
   - Executed `import_bobbybookmarks.py` to copy all bookmarks, atlas entries, embeddings, clusters, debates, nebula maps, and catalog entries successfully.

# HANDOFF — Session 2026-06-30 R17 (Swarm Compile Fix Pipeline, Wails Desktop GUI, 3 Dashboard Pages - Alpha.195)

## Summary

### Completed

1. **Swarm v7 Iterative Compile Fix (alpha.195)**: Replaced single-attempt `go build` rejection with a 3-round fix loop. When generated Go code fails, the ACTUAL compiler errors are formatted into a `make_compile_fix_prompt` and fed back to the LLM for automatic fixing. Files passing compilation are promoted to `tools/`; files failing all 3 rounds go to `_broken/`.
2. **Wails Desktop GUI**: Full build chain — `pnpm build:wails` builds Next.js standalone, `node copy-assets.mjs` extracts static assets to `frontend/dist/`, `go build ./cmd/tormentnexus-gui` produces `tormentnexus-gui.exe` (18MB).
3. **3 Dashboard Pages**: P2P Fleet-Wise Mesh, L3 Cold Archive, Enterprise Security.

### Key Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `swarm_v7.py` | Added `make_compile_fix_prompt()` + 3-round iterative compile loop |
| `copy-assets.mjs` | Extracts static HTML/CSS/JS from `.next-build/` |
| `next.config.js` | Kept as CommonJS (`.mjs` reverted) |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | alpha.195 entry with all fixes |
| `VERSION` | 1.0.0-alpha.195 |

### Next Steps

- **Swarm pipeline**: Run with `SWARM_VERIFY_COMPILE=1` to test the iterative fix pipeline in production
- **Wails polish**: Need `next.config.js` restoration (reverted from `.mjs`), turbopack NFT warning still active
- **Track A (MCP Assimilation)**: The compile fix pipeline should dramatically increase yield rate

# HANDOFF — Session 2026-06-30 R16 (Executive Protocol R6 — Full Repo Sync, Port Cleanup, CHANGELOG, Dashboard Session Import - Alpha.194)

## Summary

Completed Executive Protocol R6 — comprehensive repository synchronization and multi-priority feature work:

### Step 1: Upstream Tracking & Submodule Sanitization

- **Fetched all remotes**: `origin` (MDMAtk/TormentNexus) and `origin-backup` (HyperNexusSoft/HyperNexus) — all tags pulled
- **Upstream sync**: No upstream parent remote configured (this is the canonical fork); backup fork `HyperNexusSoft/HyperNexus` inspected — contains 19 cosmetic rename commits (TormentNexus → HyperNexus) with no functional value to merge
- **Submodule update**: `apps/maestro` (robertpelloni/maestro) updated to commit `54c9ef7e58` — no nested submodules found

### Step 2: Dual-Direction Intelligent Merge Engine

- **Forward merge (features → main)**: Inspected 298 `task/` branches — ALL at identical stale commit `25a3a95ff` (`feat: add Go-native CLI with start/stop/status commands`), which is already an ancestor of `main`. No unique development progress in any task branch. **Zero work lost.**
- **Reverse merge (main → features)**: All 298 task branches are AI dev tool stubs created at the same point in history. None have active divergent work requiring back-merge.
- **Backup fork feature branch**: `origin-backup/feature/cloud-dashboard-mcp-sse-...` also contains only HyperNexus rename commits — skipped.

### Step 3: Workspace Cleanup, Documentation & Build Finalization

- **Script validation**: Updated `start.bat` — dashboard port 3000 → 7779, health check URLs corrected
- **Version governance**: Bumped `VERSION` → `1.0.0-alpha.194`, updated `CHANGELOG.md` with alpha.192-194 entries
- **Documentation**: Updated `HANDOFF.md` with full R6 summary

### Feature Work Completed (Parallel to Sync)

1. **FTS5 bulk rebuild** — row-by-row replaced with `INSERT FROM SELECT` + `COALESCE`, async startup goroutine (alpha.193)
2. **LimboPanel** — new L4 Limbo Vault component in Memory Explorer with search + resurrection (alpha.193)
3. **Session Import dashboard page** — `/dashboard/sessions/import` with scan/list/inspect/import UI (alpha.194)
4. **Dashboard port cleanup** — health/connectivity, MCP system, swarm SSE — all legacy 4100/3001 refs removed (alpha.193)

### Running Services (verified after build)

| Port | Service | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| 7778 | Go sidecar | ✅ 59K memories, FTS indexed |
| 7779 | Dashboard | ✅ Production build clean |

### Next Steps for Successive Models

- **ChunkHound/Probe integration** — remaining native MCP search tools need Go handler wiring
- **P2P Memory Gossip** — 12/12 UDP tests pass, needs production service integration
- **Swarm Model Quality** — `swarm_v7.py` never runs `go build`; compilation verification is the single biggest quality improvement
- **L3 Cold Archive** — store layer is complete, consider adding a dedicated dashboard page for cold archive browsing
