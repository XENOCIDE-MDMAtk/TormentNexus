## Ongoing Observations & Codebase Knowledge

### 1. The Great Config Split (Fixed in 1.0.0-alpha.1)
**Observation**: Historically, `mcp.jsonc` in the user directory was intended to act as the sole source of truth. However, as SQLite was introduced, a destructive cycle emerged where `McpConfigService.syncWithDatabase()` would wipe out DB tools (and their `always_on` status) if `mcp.jsonc` lacked `_meta.tools`.
**Resolution**: We completely decoupled the manual config from the database. The system now exports a unified `.hypercode/mcp-cache.json` which the lightweight `stdioLoader` reads. DB tools are no longer destroyed by an empty JSON configuration.

### 2. The `always_on` Advertising Filter
**Observation**: `getDirectModeTools()` in `MCPServer.ts` enforces an "ULTRA-STREAMLINED ADVERTISING" filter. It ONLY returns tools marked `always_on`. If no tools have this flag, it defaults to returning *only* the internal meta-tools (`search_tools`, `load_tool`, etc.).
**Implication**: This is intended behavior to keep LLM context clean. Models are expected to use `search_tools` and `load_tool` to dynamically fetch what they need.

### 3. Config Directory Resolution
**Observation**: `getHypercodeConfigDir()` historically hardcoded `os.homedir() + '/.hypercode'`. 
**Resolution**: It now dynamically respects `process.env.HYPERCODE_CONFIG_DIR`, and falls back to checking `process.cwd()/mcp.jsonc` before defaulting to the user's home directory. This allows local repository configurations to be authoritative during development.

### 4. Binary Extraction Strategy
**Observation**: The project has aggressive plans to split into distinct daemons (`hypercoded`, `hypercodemcpd`, etc.).
**Implication**: DO NOT split these prematurely. Follow the modular-monolith-first rule defined in `UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`. Treat the Go workspaces as experimental bridges for now.

### 5. better-sqlite3 and Node 24 (Fixed 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: `better-sqlite3@12.6.2` requires native `.node` bindings compiled for the exact Node version. Node v24.10.0 broke compatibility.
**Resolution**: `pnpm rebuild better-sqlite3` works (uses prebuild-install). `node-gyp rebuild` does NOT work on Node 24.
**Implication**: After any `pnpm install`, you MUST run `pnpm rebuild better-sqlite3` on Node 24. Add this to startup checks.

### 6. Gemini Model Names Change Frequently (Updated 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: `gemini-2.0-flash` was deprecated and returns 404. The current free-tier model is `gemini-2.5-flash`.
**Implication**: When adding Gemini models, verify current availability at https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models. The ProviderRegistry should be updated whenever Google renames models.

### 7. Dashboard Polling Creates Noise
**Observation**: The Next.js dashboard polls multiple endpoints every 5 seconds, generating a constant stream of HTTP requests. If any endpoint returns 404 (like `/api/scripts`), it creates log spam and wasted cycles.
**Resolution**: Added REST API bridge routes in `orchestrator.ts` that serve the same data as the tRPC router, so the dashboard's native-control-plane fetch path works cleanly.

### 8. Worktree Complexity
**Observation**: The project uses git worktrees with the submodule structure at `.git/modules/hypercode`. The actual working directory (`hypercode-push`) can become detached from `main`.
**Resolution**: Manually update the worktree HEAD file to point to `refs/heads/main`. Don't try to use `git checkout main` across worktrees.

### 9. Go Sidecar Version Injection (Updated 2026-05-25)
**Observation**: The Go binary versioning is now managed by a topological sync across the monorepo.
**Resolution**: `go/internal/buildinfo/buildinfo.go` uses `var Version` injected at build time. Always use `scripts/build-go.sh` or the ldflags pattern to build the Go binary.

### 10. Submodule Stash Pop Conflicts (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: When updating submodules with `git merge origin/main` followed by `git stash pop`, merge conflicts appear in stash-applied files. Using `git checkout --ours` resolves to the merged main version, which is typically correct for our local changes.
**Implication**: When submodules have both upstream updates and local stashed changes, merge upstream first, then pop stash, then resolve conflicts keeping HEAD (the merged result).

### 11. Meta-Tool Decision System is Already Implemented (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: The MCP meta-tool decision system was listed as TODO but is actually fully implemented in `packages/core/src/mcp/`.
**Implication**: Do NOT re-implement. Focus on improving ranking quality, adding more profiles, and verifying the dashboard inspector shows all this data.

### 12. Package.json Sync Script Pattern (Updated 2026-05-25)
**Observation**: There are 40+ package.json files across the monorepo that all need version syncing. The Node.js script pattern (`scripts/sync-versions.js`) is more reliable than PowerShell subexpressions for this.
**Implication**: Every version bump should sync all files using the Node.js helper to avoid security blocks on shell commands.

### 13. Multi-Model Pair Programming Pattern (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: For complex tasks, a single model often hallucinates or misses edge cases. A multi-model squad with rotating roles (Planner, Implementer, Tester) provides much higher reliability.
**Resolution**: Implemented `PairOrchestrator` which coordinates Claude, GPT, and Gemini in a shared chat history.

### 14. Preemptive Tool Advertisement (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Models waste tokens and latency searching for tools.
**Resolution**: Implemented `ToolPredictor` which uses a fast LLM turn to predict needed capabilities and preloads them into the working set before the main agent turn.

### 15. Go Native Tool Execution Pattern (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Relying on the Node control plane for every tool call creates a single point of failure and higher latency.
**Resolution**: Ported core standard library and parity tools (read, write, bash, edit) to native Go in `go/internal/tools/`.

### 16. Package Build Dependency in Monorepo (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Adding new files and exports to sub-packages requires an explicit build before consumers can see changes.
**Resolution**: Run `pnpm build` in the affected sub-packages before building the consumer.

### 17. Multi-Model Swarm Pattern (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: For complex, multi-stage projects, a fixed implementation loop is sometimes too rigid.
**Resolution**: Implemented `SwarmController` which manages a team of models and evaluates progress using a "Critic" model turn.

### 18. A2A Communication Broker (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Decentralized agents need a structured way to hand off tasks and share state.
**Resolution**: Implemented `A2ABroker` (TS and Go) that routes typed messages based on agent IDs.

### 19. Session Archiving Strategy (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Long-term retention of raw JSON sessions is noisy and inefficient.
**Resolution**: Implemented `MemoryArchiver` to convert sessions to clean plaintext, extract key facts via LLM, and store them in a compressed ZIP archive.

### 20. A2A WebSocket Integration (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: The `A2ABroker` needs to reach beyond the Node process to dashboard components and remote agents.
**Resolution**: Implemented a WebSocket listener for `A2A_SIGNAL` types.

### 21. A2A Liveness and Pruning (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Decentralized agents can crash or become unreachable, leaving stale entries in the broker pool.
**Resolution**: Implemented a heartbeat mechanism in `A2ABroker`.

### 22. Deep Link Insight (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Basic webpage crawling is insufficient for automated control-plane growth.
**Resolution**: Enhanced the Go Link Crawler with an LLM turn that explicitly looks for MCP servers, skills, and APIs.

### 23. A2A Request-Response Pattern (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Simple broadcast signals are insufficient for negotiation or state lookups between agents.
**Resolution**: Implemented the `query` pattern in `A2ABroker`.

### 24. A2A Auditability (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Decentralized signaling makes it hard to understand why a swarm decision was made.
**Resolution**: Implemented `A2ALogger` in TS and Go.

### 25. Standard Tool Visibility Fix (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: The "Ultra-Streamlined Advertising" filter was too aggressive.
**Resolution**: Modified `getDirectModeTools` to treat standard library and tool parity aliases as `alwaysOn` by default.

### 26. Directory Clutter Reduction (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Hash-based directory structure for session archives was creating thousands of subdirectories.
**Resolution**: Flattened the archive structure in `ImportedSessionStore`.

### 27. Multi-Turn Agent Coordination (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Simple broadcast signaling is not enough for complex handoffs.
**Resolution**: Implemented the `query` pattern in `A2ABroker` (TS and Go).

### 28. Native Go Auditing (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Without a native logger in Go, signal traffic through the sidecar was invisible.
**Resolution**: Ported `A2ALogger` to Go.

### 29. Go Native Skill Management (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: The Go sidecar previously relied on the Node server to list and save skills.
**Resolution**: Implemented `SkillStore` in Go.

### 30. Monorepo Build Sequencing (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Changes to foundational packages often fail to propagate to consumers due to missing builds.
**Resolution**: Ensure a full topological build when introducing new protocol members.

### 31. Swarm Transcript Observability (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: High-level swarm coordination was previously a "black box" in the dashboard.
**Resolution**: Implemented the `getSwarmTranscript` tRPC endpoint and "Neural Transcript" tab.

### 32. Native Go Configuration Management (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Go sidecar dependency on Node server for reading `mcp.jsonc` limited its utility.
**Resolution**: Implemented `ConfigManager` in Go.

### 33. Specialized Swarm Personas (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Generic system prompts for swarm participants lead to role confusion.
**Resolution**: Implemented specialized system prompts for `Planner`, `Implementer`, `Tester`, and `Critic` roles.

### 34. Free-Tier Fallback Resilience (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Frequent quota exhaustion on frontier models makes the system unreliable.
**Resolution**: Expanded the fallback chain to include multiple new free-tier options.

### 35. Automated Browser Memory Ingestion (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Manually clicking "Sync to Memory" is a friction point.
**Resolution**: Implemented a `MutationObserver` in the extension's `MemoryCaptureService`.

### 36. Persistent A2A Audit Logs (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Live A2A traffic in the dashboard is transient.
**Resolution**: Created a dedicated dashboard page that reads the `a2a_traffic.jsonl` log file from disk.

### 37. Runtime Dependency Hygiene (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Adding TypeScript dev-dependencies is insufficient for runtime features.
**Resolution**: Always verify implementation libraries are in the `dependencies` block.

### 38. Cross-Runtime Handshake Parity (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Agents in Go sidecar were previously unable to participate in task-bidding.
**Resolution**: Implemented the native Go Handshake logic, matching the TS protocol.

### 39. Go Namespace Conflict Management (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Go's package-based shadowing rules can cause built-in packages to become "undefined".
**Resolution**: Added an explicit import alias when importing internal packages that collide with standard library names.

### 40. Unified Knowledge Base Persistence (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: The system previously had a "split brain" knowledge base.
**Resolution**: Fully integrated the Go native `SkillStore` with the `HighValueIngestor`.

### 41. Bidding Process Visibility (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Task negotiation between agents was an invisible internal state.
**Resolution**: Implemented negotiation tracking in `A2ABroker` and dashboard.

### 42. Truthful Sidecar Status (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Go sidecar's status endpoint returned hardcoded values.
**Resolution**: Updated Go server to check actual state of native components.

### 43. Automated Tool Integration (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Discovered tools and skills from Link Crawler were previously stagnant.
**Resolution**: Updated `HighValueIngestor` to automatically promote analyzed technical resources.

### 44. Native Go Context Harvesting (Added 2026-04-08)
**Observation**: Go sidecar's lack of a context harvester meant its memory view was out of sync.
**Resolution**: Implemented `MemoryReactor` in Go for autonomous semantic chunking.

### 45. Healer Service & L2 Vault Bridge (Added 2026-05-25)
**Observation**: Bridged the TypeScript `healerRouter.ts` to the Go-native `HealerService` and `VectorStore`. Established a pattern for mapping Go's snake_case JSON output to the PascalCase expected by the TS UI. This ensures the Go kernel remains the ground truth for system health while maintaining UI compatibility.
**Resolution**: Added a `totalCount` metric to the vault queries to fix inaccurate UI counters.

### 46. Go Sidecar JSON Serialization (Added 2026-05-25)
**Observation**: Learned that script-based code updates can inadvertently double-escape `fmt.Sprintf` tokens (`%%s`) in Go source code. Always perform a manual truth-pass or automated sed correction after bulk file writes.
**Resolution**: Established the pattern of using the `controlplane.MemoryVault` interface to decouple kernel services from the persistence implementation.

### 47. TypeScript Compile Security & Telemetry Alignment (Added 2026-05-25)
**Observation**: The environment-telemetry model updates introduced compile discrepancies in `NormalizedQuotaService.ts` due to missing properties on core `types.ts` interfaces (`ProviderAuthState`, `ProviderQuotaSnapshot`).
**Resolution**: Formally defined `ProviderAuthTruth` and added the missing telemetry properties (`authTruth`, `quotaConfidence`, `quotaRefreshedAt`) to `packages/core/src/providers/types.ts`. Eliminated all redundant `@ts-expect-error` directives, achieving a 100% clean build.
